# Knowledge Base

This folder contains decision records, patterns, and research that inform development on this project.

## Purpose

When starting new work, consult relevant files here first. They capture:
- Architecture decisions and their rationale
- Patterns discovered during refactoring
- Research on upstream behavior or API contracts
- Setup and configuration decisions

## Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for filenames: `topic-description.md`
- Keep files **topic-focused** — one decision or pattern per file
- Start each file with a brief **what/why** summary

## Adding New Entries

Create a new markdown file when you:
- Make a non-obvious architecture decision
- Discover a pattern that affects multiple files
- Research something that took significant effort to understand
- Set up infrastructure that others need to replicate
